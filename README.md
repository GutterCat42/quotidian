# Quotidian
*Meaning 'occuring daily'. A play on words because it sounds like 'quote'*

You know that feeling you get when one of your friends says something absolutely hilarious/outrageous/embarassing and you just know you have to write it down and save for later, and then before long you have >10 memos on your phone or laptop that take 2 minutes to load?

Well, this piece of software aims to act as a nice central place to document all your quotes for historical preservation.

It's made in python using tkinter (I know its ugly) because I dont know anything else. When I learn a better way of making GUIs then I might remake this.
